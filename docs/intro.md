# Interview Notes

Interview Notes is a collection of interview questions and concepts, including system design interview questions and answers, spanning a wide range of topics. The questions are categorized based on programming languages, system components, and features.

I started this project to help myself and others prepare for interviews. The answers provide a detailed explanation of the concepts and the approach to solve the problem.

## Categories

- **[Languages:](/docs/languages/java/)** Questions related to various programming languages and their features.
- **[Microservices:](/docs/microservices/intro)** Questions related to microservices architecture and design patterns.
- **[System Design:](/docs/designs)** Questions related to designing scalable and efficient systems.
- **[Algorithms and Data Structures:](/docs/programming/lld/)** Competitive programming questions and concepts.
- **[Behavioral Questions:](/docs/behavioral)** Questions related to teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills.
