### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

### What are the features of React?
- It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
- It uses server-side rendering.
- It follows unidirectional data flow or data binding.

### What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML. JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript.

### What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?
Real DOM | Virtual DOM
--- | ---
It updates slow | It updates faster
Can directly update HTML | Can't directly update HTML
Creates a new DOM if element updates | Updates the JSX if element updates
Too much of memory wastage | No memory wastage

### What is the use of ReactDOM in React?
ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. It provides the method `render()` that is used to render the components.

### What is the use of render() in React?
The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component. It is called by React to render the component. It returns a React element which is a lightweight description of what to render.

### What is Props in React?
Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. But the important part is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

### What is State in React?
State is a built-in React object that contains data that influences the output of render. The state is mutable, i.e., it can be changed. The state must be kept in the parent component. It is used to store the data that the component may need to change over time.

### What is the difference between state and props in React?
State | Props
--- | ---
State is mutable | Props are immutable
State is an object | Props are an argument
State changes inside the component | Props are passed to the component
State is local or owned by the component | Props are owned by the parent component

### What is the use of setState() in React?
The `setState()` method is used to update the state of a component. It is used to update the state of the component. It will trigger the render method and the updated component will be displayed on the screen.

### What is the use of keys in React?
Keys are used to identify unique Virtual DOM Elements with their corresponding data driving the UI. It is used to identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

### What is the use of refs in React?
Refs are used to get reference to a DOM (Document Object Model) node or an instance of a component in React. It is used to access the DOM nodes directly within React.

### What is the use of context in React?
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components.

### What is the use of React Hooks?
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

### What are the rules for Hooks?
- Only call Hooks at the top level.
- Only call Hooks from React functions.
- Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
- Only call Hooks from React functional components.

### What are the advantages of using React Hooks?
- It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- It allows you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.
- It allows you to use more of React’s features without classes.

### What are the limitations of using React Hooks?
- It is hard to reuse stateful logic between components.
- It is hard to understand the complex components.
- It is hard to test the components.

### What is the use of useEffect in React?
The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It is a close replacement for `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods in class components.

### What is the use of useReducer in React?
The `useReducer` hook is used to manage complex state logic in React. It is an alternative to `useState`. It is mostly used to manage state objects that contain multiple sub-values.

### What is the use of useMemo in React?
The `useMemo` hook is used to optimize the performance of the functional components. It is used to memorize the output of a function and return the cached result when the input is the same.

### What is the use of useCallback in React?
The `useCallback` hook is used to optimize the performance of the functional components. It is used to memorize the callback functions and return the cached result when the input is the same.

### What is the use of useContext in React?
The `useContext` hook is used to consume the context in a functional component. It is used to access the context value and re-renders the component when the context value changes.

### What is the use of useImperativeHandle in React?
The `useImperativeHandle` hook is used to customize the instance value that is exposed to the parent components when using `ref`. It is used to hide some of the properties of the instance value.

### What is the use of useLayoutEffect in React?
The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to perform the side effects in a functional component. It is similar to `useEffect` but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.

### What is the use of useDebugValue in React?
The `useDebugValue` hook is used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools. It is used to display the label for custom hooks in the React DevTools.

### What is the use of forwardRef in React?
The `forwardRef` function is used to forward the ref from the parent component to the child component. It is used to forward the ref from the parent component to the child component.

### What is the use of Fragment in React?
The `Fragment` component is used to group multiple children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It is used to group multiple children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

### What is the use of Profiler in React?
The `Profiler` component is used to measure the cost of rendering a part of the application. It is used to measure the cost of rendering a part of the application.

### What is the use of Suspense in React?
The `Suspense` component is used to show a loading indicator while the child components are being loaded. It is used to show a loading indicator while the child components are being loaded.

### What is the use of Error Boundary in React?
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

### What is the use of Portals in React?
Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

### What is the use of Higher-Order Components in React?
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

### What is the use of Render Props in React?
A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render. This technique makes it easy to share code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

### What is the use of Context in React?
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components.



### What is the use of PureComponent in React?
`PureComponent` is exactly the same as `Component` except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate` method for you. When props or state changes, `PureComponent` will do a shallow comparison on both props and state.

### What is the use of React.memo in React?
`React.memo` is a higher order component. It’s similar to `React.PureComponent` but for function components instead of classes. It is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the functional components.

### What is the use of createRef in React?
The `createRef` function is used to create a reference to the DOM nodes or React elements. It is used to access the DOM nodes directly within React.

### What is the use of forwardRef in React?
The `forwardRef` function is used to forward the ref from the parent component to the child component. It is used to forward the ref from the parent component to the child component.

### What is the use of lazy and Suspense in React?
`lazy` and `Suspense` are used to load the components lazily. It is used to load the components only when they are needed.
