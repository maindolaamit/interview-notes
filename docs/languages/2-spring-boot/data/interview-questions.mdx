   Tip: Focus on its unified repository model, support for multiple data stores, and auto‑configuration features.  
   :::

2. How does Spring Data abstract data access from multiple sources?  
   :::tip  
   Tip: Mention repository interfaces, templates, and declarative transactions.
   :::

1. What are the key differences between `JpaRepository` and `CrudRepository`?  
2. How do you handle entity relationships (One‑to‑Many, Many‑to‑Many) in JPA?  
3. Explain lazy loading and its impact on performance.  
4. What are the common performance improvements in Hibernate (batch updates, caching, etc.)?  
   :::tip  
   Tip: Explain how statement caching and connection pooling contribute to performance.
   :::

## NoSQL

1. What are the advantages and limitations of schema‑less databases versus relational databases?
