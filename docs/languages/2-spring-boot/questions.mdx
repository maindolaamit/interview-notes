### What is the difference between `context.close()` and `context.registerShutdownHook `?

`context.close()` is used to close the application context and release all resources. It is a synchronous operation. `context.registerShutdownHook()` is used to register a shutdown hook with the JVM runtime. It is an asynchronous operation.

### What ways can we invoke the Bean Life Cycle methods ?

There are three ways to invoke the Bean Life Cycle methods:

1. **Using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations**: These annotations are used to define the init and destroy methods.
2. **Implementing `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces**: These interfaces are used to define the init and destroy methods.
3. **Using `init-method` and `destroy-method` attributes in the XML configuration**: These attributes are used to define the init and destroy methods.

### What is the difference between Application Context and Web Application Context?
`ApplicationContext` is the central interface in Springâ€™s core container and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of beans,
instantiating and configuring them, wiring them together, and handling their dependencies.
It is used in standalone applications and non-web environments.

`WebApplicationContext` is a sub-interface of `ApplicationContext` and is used in web applications. It provides additional features specific to web applications,
such as support for themes, file uploads, and internationalization. It is created by the `ContextLoaderListener` or `DispatcherServlet` in a web application.

The key difference between `ApplicationContext` and `WebApplicationContext` is that the latter is designed for web applications and provides additional features specific to web environments.

### 4.	How to set profile at the runtime in SpringBoot Framework? We can take WebApplication context, modify the container and register it.
    ```java
    ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
    context.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("dev");
    context.refresh();
    ```



### What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Controller` annotations?

`@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component.
`@Repository` is a stereotype annotation for a DAO component.
`@Service` is a stereotype annotation for a service component.
`@Controller` is a stereotype annotation for a controller component.

Basically, all Beans are extending @Component but providing extra features like Exception Handling etc. based on the Annotation.
For e.g., Repository adds DataException over JDBC to handle exceptions.

### What is the difference between `@ComponentScan` and `@SpringBootApplication` annotations?

`@ComponentScan` is used to scan the packages for Spring components. `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the package, allowing it to find the controllers.

### What is the difference between `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier` annotations?

`@Autowired` is used to autowire a bean on the basis of type. `@Qualifier` is used to autowire a bean on the basis of the name of the bean.

### What is the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` annotations?

`@RequestParam` is used to extract query parameters from the URL. `@PathVariable` is used to extract values from the URI.

### What is the difference between `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` annotations?

`@GetMapping` is used to handle HTTP GET requests. `@PostMapping` is used to handle HTTP POST requests.

### What is the difference between `@Transactional` and `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotations?

`@Transactional` is used to mark a method as transactional. `@EnableTransactionManagement` is used to enable transaction management.

### What is the difference between `@Bean` and `@Component` annotations?

`@Bean` is used to define a bean explicitly. `@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component.

### What is the difference between `@Configuration` and `@Component` annotations?

`@Configuration` is used to define a configuration class. `@Component` is a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component.

### What is the difference between `@Scope` and `@Profile` annotations?

`@Scope` is used to define the scope of a bean. `@Profile` is used to define the profile of a bean.

### What is the difference between `@Value` and `@PropertySource` annotations?

`@Value` is used to inject values from properties files. `@PropertySource` is used to define the properties file.

### What is the difference between `@EnableWebMvc` and `@SpringBootApplication` annotations?

`@EnableWebMvc` is used to enable Spring MVC. `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the package, allowing it to find the controllers.

### What is the difference between `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` annotations?

`@EnableScheduling` is used to enable scheduling. `@Scheduled` is used to define the schedule of a method.

### What is the difference between `@EnableCaching` and `@Cacheable` annotations?

`@EnableCaching` is used to enable caching. `@Cacheable` is used to cache the result of a method.

### What is the difference between `@EnableAsync` and `@Async` annotations?

`@EnableAsync` is used to enable asynchronous processing. `@Async` is used to define a method as asynchronous.

###	How do you create your own custom Annotation in Java?
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value();
}
```
