### Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
Vertical scaling, referred to as “scale up”, means the process of adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to your servers. Horizontal scaling, referred to as “scale-out”, allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources.

When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option, and the simplicity of vertical scaling is its main advantage. Unfortunately, it comes with serious limitations.
- Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server.
- Vertical scaling does not have failower and redundancy. If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely.
Horizontal scaling is more desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling.

<summary>What is Reliability?</summary>
- Reliability is the probability that a system will fail in a given period.
- An often quoted reliability standard is the "five nines" (99.999 percent) reliability. This allows for 5.26 minutes of downtime per year.
- A Distributed system will be considered reliable it it is able to provide the same service even if one or more of its components fail.
- Any failing node can be replaced with a new node without affecting the service.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Availability?</summary>
- Availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period.
- Availability is usually measured as a percentage of uptime in a given year.
- Availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime)
- A system that is highly available will be able to provide service even if one or more of its components fail.
- Any failing node can be replaced with a new node without affecting the service.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Durability?</summary>
- Durability is the ability of a system to recover from component failures and continue to function.
- Durability is usually measured as the mean time to failure (MTTF) or mean time between failures (MTBF).
- Durability is usually measured in years.
- A system that is highly durable will be able to recover from component failures and continue to function.
- Any failing node can be replaced with a new node without affecting the service.
</details>


<details>
<summary>What is Scalability?</summary>
- Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system.
- A system that scales well will be able to maintain or even increase its level of performance or service even as it gets larger.
- Scalability can be measured in terms of latency or throughput.
- Latency is the time taken to respond to a request.
- Throughput is the number of requests a system can handle per second.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Latency?</summary>
- Latency is the time taken for a request to travel from the client to the server and back, usually measured in milliseconds.
- Latency is affected by the distance between the client and the server.
- Latency is also affected by the number of hops between the client and the server.
- Latency is also affected by the number of requests the server is handling at a given time.
- Latency is also affected by the size of the requests.
- Latency is also affected by the size of the responses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Throughput?</summary>
- Throughput is the number of requests a system can handle per second, usually measured in requests per second.
- Throughput is affected by the number of requests the server is handling at a given time.
- Throughput is also affected by the size of the requests.
- Throughput is also affected by the size of the responses.
</details>

### CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more than two out of three of the following guarantees:
- Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
- Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

<details>
<summary>What is Consistency?</summary>
- Consistency is the guarantee that all nodes in a distributed system will have the same data at the same time.
- Consistency is usually measured as the time it takes for the data to be replicated across all nodes.
- Consistency is usually measured in milliseconds.
- A system that is highly consistent will have the same data across all nodes at the same time.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Partition Tolerance?</summary>
- Partition Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue to function even if the network is partitioned.
- A system that is highly partition tolerant will continue to function even if the network is partitioned.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is BASE?</summary>
- BASE is an acronym for Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency.
- BASE is a set of principles that inform how distributed systems should be designed.
- BASE is an alternative to ACID.
- BASE is used to describe the properties of many NoSQL databases.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is ACID?</summary>
- ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- ACID is a set of principles that inform how distributed systems should be designed.
- ACID is used to describe the properties of many SQL databases.
