    <summary>Latency vs Response Time</summary>
    - Response time is the time taken to respond to a request.
    - Latency is the time request waiting to be handled - during which it was latent.
</details>

- `head-of-line` blocking: it only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests.
- An `SLO `is a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured, monitored, and reported.
- An `SLA `may state that the service is considered to be up if it has a median response time of less than 200 ms and a 99th percentile under 1 s (if the
response time is longer, it might as well be down), and the service may be required to be up at least 99.9% of the time.
These metrics set expectations for clients of the service and allow customers to demand a refund if the `SLA `is not met.
