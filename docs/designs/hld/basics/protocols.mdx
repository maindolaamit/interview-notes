REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles
of HTTP. It emphasizes simple data formats, using URLs for identifying
resources and using HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content
type negotiation

### SOAP
The API of a SOAP web service is described using an XML-based language called the
Web Services Description Language, or WSDL. WSDL enables code generation so
that a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls (which
are encoded to XML messages and decoded again by the framework). This is useful in
statically typed programming languages, but less so in dynamically typed ones


As WSDL is not designed to be human-readable, and as SOAP messages are often too
complex to construct manually, users of SOAP rely heavily on tool support


### RPC

#### Difference between RPC and Local function calls
- A local function call is predictable and either succeeds or fails, depending only on parameters that are under your control.
A network request is unpredictable: the request or response may be lost due to a network problem, or the remote
machine may be slow or unavailable, and such problems are entirely outside of your control.
Network problems are common, so you have to anticipate them, for example by retrying a failed request.
- A local function call either returns a result, or throws an exception, or never returns (because it goes into an infinite
loop or the process crashes). A network request has another possible outcome: it may return without a result, due to a
timeout. In that case, you simply don’t know what happened: if you don’t get a response from the remote service, you
have no way of knowing whether the request got through or not.
- Every time you call a local function, it normally takes about the same time to execute. A network request is much slower
than a function call, and its latency is also wildly variable:
- When you call a local function, you can efficiently pass it references (pointers) to objects in local memory. When you
make a network request, all those parameters need to be encoded into a sequence of bytes that can be sent over the network.
That’s okay if the parameters are primitives like numbers or strings, but quickly becomes problematic with larger objects.


**gRPC supports streams, where a call consists of not just one request and one response, but a series of requests and responses over time**



### Message brokers
A topic provides only one-way dataflow. However, a consumer may itself publish messages to another topic (so you can chain
them together), or to a reply queue that is consumed by the sender of the original message (allowing a request/response dataflow, similar to RPC).
