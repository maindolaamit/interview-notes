<summary>API Gateway</summary>

API Gateway is a design pattern that aggregates multiple microservice APIs into a single entry point, simplifying external access and enforcing security policies.
Key features of an API Gateway include:
- **Request routing:** Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request URL or parameters.
- **Security:** Enforces authentication, authorization, and rate limiting policies to protect microservices from unauthorized access and abuse.
- **Protocol translation:** Translates incoming requests from external clients to the appropriate protocol and message format used by microservices.
- **Aggregation:** Combines multiple microservice responses into a single response to fulfill complex client requests.
- **Monitoring and logging:** Provides centralized monitoring and logging capabilities to track API usage and performance.
- **Caching:** Caches responses from microservices to improve response times and reduce load on backend services.
API Gateways are commonly implemented using technologies like NGINX, Kong, Apigee, and AWS API Gateway.

### What is a Reverse Proxy ?
A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public. Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.

```

Additional benefits include:

- Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
- Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
- SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
- Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server
- Compression - Compress server responses
- Caching - Return the response for cached requests
- Static content - Serve static content directly like HTML/CSS/JS, Photos, Videos , etc.



### Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy
Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
- A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure
- Configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.
