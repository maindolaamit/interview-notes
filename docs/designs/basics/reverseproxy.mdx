<summary>API Gateway</summary>

API Gateway is a design pattern that aggregates multiple microservice APIs into a single entry point, simplifying external access and enforcing security policies.
Key features of an API Gateway include:
- **Request routing:** Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request URL or parameters.
- **Security:** Enforces authentication, authorization, and rate limiting policies to protect microservices from unauthorized access and abuse.
- **Protocol translation:** Translates incoming requests from external clients to the appropriate protocol and message format used by microservices.
- **Aggregation:** Combines multiple microservice responses into a single response to fulfill complex client requests.
- **Monitoring and logging:** Provides centralized monitoring and logging capabilities to track API usage and performance.
- **Caching:** Caches responses from microservices to improve response times and reduce load on backend services.
API Gateways are commonly implemented using technologies like NGINX, Kong, Apigee, and AWS API Gateway.
