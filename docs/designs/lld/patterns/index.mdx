### What is a Design Pattern?
`Design patterns` are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The
pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern
details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never
encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

:::note
Cost and time are two of the most valuable metrics when
developing any software product. Less time in development
means entering the market earlier than competitors. Lower
development costs mean more money is left for marketing and
a broader reach to potential customers.

##### Classifications of a pattern

<details>
  <summary>Maintainability</summary>
  - A good design should be maintainable, i.e. it should be designed in a way that it is easy to fix the bugs.
  - It should be easy to understand and modify.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Loose Coupling</summary>
  - A good design should have loose coupling between various modules.
  - Loose coupling means that the modules are not dependent on each other.
  - This makes the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>High Cohesion</summary>
  - A good design should have high cohesion between various modules.
  - High cohesion means that the code within a single module is highly related.
  - This makes the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Low Coupling and High Cohesion</summary>
  - Low coupling and high cohesion are two important features of a good design.
  - Low coupling means that the modules are not dependent on each other.
  - High cohesion means that the code within a single module is highly related.
  - Low coupling and high cohesion make the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Separation of Concerns</summary>
  - A good design should have separation of concerns.
  - Separation of concerns means that the code should be divided into different modules based on what they do so that
  each module is responsible for a single functionality.
  - This makes the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Don't Repeat Yourself</summary>
  - A good design should follow the don't repeat yourself principle.
  - Don't repeat yourself principle means that the code should not be repeated.
  - Instead, it should be abstracted into a common method or class.
  - This makes the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Keep It Simple Stupid</summary>
  - A good design should follow the keep it simple stupid principle.
  - Keep it simple stupid principle means that the design should be simple.
  - This makes the design more extensible and maintainable.
</details>
