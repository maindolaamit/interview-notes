# SOLID Principles
Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) introduced the SOLID principles in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns. The SOLID principles are the five principles of good object-oriented programming and design. The SOLID principles are:
<details>
<summary>Single Responsibility Principle</summary>
- A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

If a class does more than one job, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility. This leads to fragile designs that break in many places.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Open-Closed Principle</summary>
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Liskov Substitution Principle</summary>
Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Interface Segregation Principle</summary>
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Dependency Inversion Principle</summary>
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
</details>

:::tip
Using these principles mindlessly can cause more harm than good. The SOLID principles are guidelines, not rules. They are not meant to be followed blindly. They are meant to be used as a guide to help you create better designs.
