## Making Difficult Decisions: Letting Go Underperforming Team Members

**I'll share how I handled the difficult but necessary decision to let go team members who didn't meet performance standards.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** At Nordstrom, when I was building my Run & Maintain team from scratch, I hired 30 developers within 6 months. However, after several months of working with the team, it became clear that 10 developers were not meeting the performance criteria and quality standards required for our projects.

**Task:** I needed to make the difficult decision to let go these underperforming team members while maintaining team morale and ensuring project continuity. This was challenging because it involved people's livelihoods and could impact team dynamics.

**Action:**
- **Performance Documentation:** I maintained detailed documentation of performance issues, including specific examples of missed deadlines, quality problems, and feedback provided
- **Improvement Plans:** I created individual improvement plans for each underperforming team member, providing clear expectations and support
- **Regular Check-ins:** I conducted weekly one-on-ones to monitor progress and provide additional coaching and resources
- **Fair Assessment:** After 3 months of improvement plans, I conducted a fair assessment of each team member's progress
- **Compassionate Process:** I handled the termination process with empathy, providing clear feedback about why the decision was made and offering support for their transition

**Result:** I successfully let go 10 developers who weren't meeting standards, which improved overall team performance and project quality. The remaining team members appreciated the higher standards and became more motivated. The team became more cohesive and productive, with clear performance expectations.

### Key Principles I Followed:

1. **Documentation:** Keeping detailed records of performance issues and improvement efforts
2. **Fair Process:** Giving everyone a chance to improve with clear expectations and support
3. **Compassion:** Handling the process with empathy and respect for the individuals
4. **Team Impact:** Considering how decisions affect the entire team's morale and performance
5. **Business Needs:** Balancing individual circumstances with business requirements

### How I Maintained Team Morale:

- **Transparent Communication:** I explained the performance standards and why they were important for team success
- **Recognition:** I recognized and rewarded high performers to maintain positive motivation
- **Clear Expectations:** I established clear performance criteria for all team members
- **Support Systems:** I provided training and resources to help team members succeed

### Lessons Learned:

This experience taught me that making difficult decisions about underperforming team members is sometimes necessary for the overall health and success of the team. It's important to be fair, compassionate, and transparent throughout the process while maintaining high standards for performance and quality.

### Why This Experience Matters:

This experience demonstrates my ability to make tough decisions while maintaining team morale and ensuring business success. It shows that I can balance compassion with performance standards, which is crucial for effective leadership at Nordstrom.
