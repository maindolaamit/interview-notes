## My Greatest Accomplishment: Building a High-Performing Team from Scratch at Nordstrom

**I'm most proud of building a complete team from scratch at Nordstrom, which represents the culmination of my leadership and management skills.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** When I joined Nordstrom in March 2025 as a Manager for the new Run & Maintain team, I was given the opportunity to build a team from scratch to handle multiple complex projects ranging from Oracle EBS to Data Engineering using AWS, Elastic Search, Kafka, and Spark.

**Task:** I needed to hire 30 developers within 6 months, establish team processes, create documentation standards, manage multiple vendors, and ensure successful delivery of complex projects while taking on additional roles as Product Manager and Scrum Master.

**Action:**
- **Strategic Hiring:** I developed a comprehensive hiring process with technical assessments and cultural fit evaluations, working with multiple vendors to source quality developers
- **Process Establishment:** I created agile processes, code review standards, and documentation practices from day one
- **Distributed Team Management:** I established clear communication protocols for the 70% India-based and 30% nearshore (Mexico, Costa Rica) team
- **Multi-Role Management:** I took on Product Manager and Scrum Master responsibilities, including Jira workflows, sprint planning, and backlog grooming
- **Vendor Coordination:** I managed relationships with multiple vendors while balancing internal stakeholder expectations
- **Performance Management:** I established clear performance criteria and made difficult decisions to let go 10 developers who didn't meet standards
- **Knowledge Sharing:** I implemented regular knowledge sharing sessions, pair programming, and mentoring programs

**Result:** Successfully built a team of 23 high-performing developers, delivered multiple projects on time, and created a scalable team management process. The team became known for its efficiency, quality of work, and strong documentation practices. I also established quarterly and yearly planning processes to manage management expectations effectively.

### Why This Accomplishment is Special:

1. **Scale:** Building a team of 20+ people from scratch is a significant undertaking
2. **Complexity:** Managing multiple technologies and project types simultaneously
3. **Stakeholders:** Coordinating with vendors, management, and team members across different locations
4. **Multi-Role:** Taking on Product Manager and Scrum Master roles in addition to Engineering Manager responsibilities
5. **Results:** Delivering successful projects while building the team and processes

### Additional Accomplishments I'm Proud Of:

**Masters in Data Science (2019-2021):** While working full-time at Expedia, I completed my Masters in Data Science from BITS Pilani (among top 20 universities in India). This required balancing work and studies, learning new technologies like Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow, and applying machine learning concepts to real-world problems.

**Expedia Cloud Transition:** Leading the transition from Oracle Apps to modern microservices architecture, learning multiple new technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, ReactJS) quickly, and working with a distributed team across different time zones.

**Pepsico Product Development:** Developing a new product that can be used by various verticals to create ServiceNow Forms and integrate with various systems, using ReactJS for UI and Java Spring Boot for backend.

### Personal Accomplishments:

**Weight Loss Achievement:** I've lost more than 20 lbs of weight in 2 months, and I've done this 3 times. I developed my own method of exercise and diet that works for me, demonstrating discipline and consistency.

**36 KM Trekking:** I completed a 36 KM trekking in a single day in the Himalayas, which was a significant physical and mental challenge.

**Teaching Underprivileged Kids:** At Infosys, I taught underprivileged kids in a village near Chandigarh for over 2 years, which taught me the importance of giving back to society.

### Why These Accomplishments Matter:

These accomplishments demonstrate my ability to:
- Build and lead high-performing teams
- Learn new technologies quickly
- Balance multiple responsibilities
- Maintain discipline and consistency
- Give back to the community
- Handle physical and mental challenges
- Deliver results under pressure

### How This Experience Prepares Me for Future Success:

Building the team at Nordstrom taught me how to:
- Create sustainable processes and documentation
- Manage complex stakeholder relationships
- Handle multiple responsibilities simultaneously
- Make difficult decisions while maintaining team morale
- Work effectively in distributed environments
- Scale teams and processes effectively

This accomplishment represents the culmination of my leadership journey and demonstrates my ability to handle complex, multi-faceted challenges while delivering results and building strong teams.
