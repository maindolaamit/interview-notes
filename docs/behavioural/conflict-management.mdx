## Managing Team Conflicts at Expedia

**I'll share how I successfully managed conflicts within my team during a challenging project transition.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** At Expedia in 2019, I was leading a cloud engineering team transition from Oracle Apps to modern microservices. The team was experiencing conflicts due to different learning speeds, workload distribution issues, and communication challenges between US and India-based team members.

**Task:** I needed to resolve the growing tensions within the team while ensuring project delivery and maintaining team morale. The conflicts were affecting productivity and creating a negative work environment.

**Action:** 
- **Individual Meetings:** I scheduled private one-on-one meetings with each team member to understand their perspectives and concerns
- **Team Discussion:** I facilitated an open team meeting where everyone could share their challenges and frustrations in a safe environment
- **Workload Redistribution:** I analyzed the workload and redistributed tasks based on individual strengths and learning curves
- **Communication Protocols:** I established clear communication channels and regular check-ins to prevent future misunderstandings
- **Support Systems:** I implemented pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions to help team members learn from each other

**Result:** The team conflicts were resolved, leading to improved collaboration, better work-life balance for all team members, and successful project delivery. The team became more cohesive and productive, with clear communication protocols that prevented future conflicts.

### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Early Intervention:** Addressing conflicts early prevents them from escalating
2. **Active Listening:** Understanding each person's perspective is crucial for finding solutions
3. **Transparent Communication:** Open discussions about challenges lead to better outcomes
4. **Fair Distribution:** Ensuring equitable workload distribution reduces resentment
5. **Support Systems:** Providing learning support helps team members grow together

### How This Experience Helps at Nordstrom:

This experience directly applies to managing the distributed team at Nordstrom, where I need to handle conflicts between team members across different time zones and locations. My ability to facilitate difficult conversations and find win-win solutions would be valuable in maintaining team harmony and productivity.

### Additional Conflict Management Example:

**At Nordstrom:** When building my team from scratch, I had to manage conflicts between vendors providing developers and internal stakeholders. I established clear communication protocols and regular alignment meetings to prevent misunderstandings and ensure smooth collaboration.
