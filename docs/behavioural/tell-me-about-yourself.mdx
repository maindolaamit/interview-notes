# Tell Me About Yourself

## Professional Introduction (2-3 minutes)

"I'm a Senior Developer cum technology leader with over 15 years of experience spanning Oracle EBS, cloud technologies, and modern microservices architectures. 
My career has been defined by three key strengths: quick adaptability, technical versatility, and process-oriented approach.

Most recently at Nordstrom, I built a team of 23 developers from scratch, managing a distributed workforce across multiple time zones while establishing scalable processes and documentation standards. 
I often took on additional responsibilities including Product Manager and Scrum Master roles when those positions were vacant, creating Jira workflows, sprint planning processes, and backlog management systems.

Prior to that, at Expedia, I led the transition from Oracle Apps to a modern microservices architecture, quickly adapting to new technologies like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and ReactJS. During this time, I also completed my Masters in Data Science from BITS Pilani while working full-time, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning.

At PepsiCo, I developed new products integrating ServiceNow Forms with various systems using ReactJS for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend, showcasing my technical versatility across multiple technology stacks.

What sets me apart is my balanced leadership approachâ€”I make tough decisions while maintaining team morale, establish clear processes for everything I do, and continuously learn and share knowledge with my teams. I believe in creating scalable solutions that prioritize long-term sustainability over quick fixes.

I'm passionate about building and designing high-performing products, tackling complex technical challenges, and establishing best practices that improve efficiency and quality."

## Tailoring Tips

- **For technical roles**: Emphasize your experience with relevant technologies and technical transitions.
- **For leadership roles**: Focus on your team-building experience, process creation, and stakeholder management.
- **For product-focused roles**: Highlight your experience as a Product Manager and your ability to prioritize and manage backlogs.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Keep it concise**: 2-3 minutes maximum
2. **Focus on recent experience**: Emphasize your most recent and relevant roles
3. **Highlight achievements**: Mention specific accomplishments rather than just responsibilities
4. **Connect to the role**: Subtly link your experience to the position you're interviewing for
5. **End with interest**: Finish by expressing genuine interest in the role and company

## Additional Notes
