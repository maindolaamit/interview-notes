## My Greatest Strength: Building and Leading High-Performing Teams

**My greatest strength is my ability to build and lead high-performing teams, especially in challenging and distributed environments.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** When I joined Nordstrom in March 2025 as a Manager for the new Run & Maintain team, I was tasked with building a team from scratch to handle multiple projects ranging from Oracle EBS to Data Engineering using AWS, Elastic Search, Kafka and Spark.

**Task:** I needed to hire 30 developers within 6 months, manage a distributed team (70% in India, 30% in nearshore locations like Mexico and Costa Rica), and ensure successful delivery of multiple complex projects while maintaining high performance standards.

**Action:** 
- Implemented a rigorous hiring process with technical assessments and cultural fit evaluations
- Created comprehensive onboarding documentation and knowledge sharing sessions
- Established clear communication protocols for distributed teams with limited overlapping hours
- Implemented pair programming, code reviews, and regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Created quarterly and yearly planning processes to manage management expectations
- Took on additional roles as Product Manager and Scrum Master when those roles were vacant
- Made difficult decisions to let go 10 developers who didn't meet performance criteria

**Result:** Successfully built a team of 23 high-performing developers, delivered multiple projects on time, and created a scalable team management process. The team became known for its efficiency and quality of work, with strong documentation practices and knowledge sharing culture.

### Why This Strength Matters for Nordstrom:

This strength directly aligns with Nordstrom's need for strong leadership in managing distributed teams and complex technical projects. My experience in building teams from scratch, managing performance, and creating scalable processes would be invaluable in driving success at Nordstrom.

### Additional Supporting Examples:

**At Expedia (2018-2023):** Led a cloud engineering team transition from Oracle Apps to modern microservices architecture, managing team dynamics and ensuring successful delivery despite initial resistance to new technologies.

**At Milagro (2016):** As Technical Manager, led a team of 5 developers on a Datawarehouse project, managing client expectations and delivering on time despite cost constraints and working with freshers.
