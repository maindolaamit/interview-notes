## Building a High-Performing Team from Scratch at Nordstrom

**I'll share my experience of building a complete team from scratch, which is one of my most significant leadership achievements.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** When I joined Nordstrom in March 2025 as a Manager for the new Run & Maintain team, I was tasked with building a team from scratch to handle multiple complex projects ranging from Oracle EBS to Data Engineering using AWS, Elastic Search, Kafka, and Spark.

**Task:** I needed to hire 30 developers within 6 months, establish team processes, create documentation standards, and ensure successful delivery of multiple projects while managing a distributed team across different time zones and locations.

**Action:**
- **Strategic Hiring:** I developed a comprehensive hiring process with technical assessments, cultural fit evaluations, and behavioral interviews
- **Vendor Management:** I worked closely with multiple vendors to source quality developers, establishing clear expectations and performance criteria
- **Team Structure:** I created a clear organizational structure with defined roles and responsibilities for the distributed team
- **Process Implementation:** I established agile processes, code review standards, and documentation practices from day one
- **Knowledge Sharing:** I implemented regular knowledge sharing sessions, pair programming, and mentoring programs
- **Communication Protocols:** I created clear communication channels and meeting schedules to manage the distributed team effectively
- **Performance Management:** I established clear performance criteria and regular feedback mechanisms

**Result:** Successfully built a team of 23 high-performing developers, delivered multiple projects on time, and created a scalable team management process. The team became known for its efficiency, quality of work, and strong documentation practices. I also had to make difficult decisions to let go 10 developers who didn't meet performance standards, ultimately creating a more cohesive and productive team.

### Key Strategies I Used:

1. **Quality Over Quantity:** I focused on hiring the right people rather than just filling positions quickly
2. **Clear Expectations:** I established clear performance standards and communication protocols from the beginning
3. **Documentation First:** I prioritized documentation and knowledge sharing to ensure team sustainability
4. **Distributed Team Management:** I created processes specifically designed for managing teams across different time zones
5. **Continuous Improvement:** I regularly assessed and improved team processes based on feedback and results

### Challenges Overcome:

- **Time Zone Coordination:** Managing a team with 70% in India and 30% in nearshore locations (Mexico, Costa Rica)
- **Vendor Relationships:** Balancing expectations between multiple vendors and internal stakeholders
- **Performance Standards:** Maintaining high quality standards while scaling the team quickly
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Ensuring new team members could quickly ramp up and contribute effectively

### Additional Responsibilities Taken On:

Since there was no Program Manager or Product Manager initially, I also took on their roles, including:
- Creating Jira workflows and sprint planning
- Backlog grooming and prioritization
- Stakeholder communication and expectation management
- Quarterly and yearly planning

### Why This Experience is Valuable:

This experience demonstrates my ability to build and scale teams effectively, manage complex stakeholder relationships, and create sustainable processes. It shows that I can take on multiple roles when needed and deliver results under challenging circumstances.

### Lessons Learned:

1. **Process is Key:** Having clear processes from the beginning prevents chaos and ensures consistency
2. **Communication is Critical:** Regular, transparent communication is essential for distributed teams
3. **Quality Standards:** Maintaining high standards from the beginning is easier than trying to improve later
4. **Flexibility:** Being willing to take on additional roles when needed helps ensure project success
5. **Team Culture:** Building a positive team culture from the start creates long-term success
