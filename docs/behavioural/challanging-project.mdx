## My Most Challenging Project: Building Nordstrom's Run & Maintain Team from Scratch

**I'll share my most challenging project - building a complete team from scratch while managing multiple complex projects and stakeholders.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** When I joined Nordstrom in March 2025 as a Manager for the new Run & Maintain team, I was tasked with building a team from scratch to handle multiple projects ranging from Oracle EBS to Data Engineering using AWS, Elastic Search, Kafka, and Spark. The challenge was compounded by the need to manage a distributed team across different time zones and locations.

**Task:** I needed to hire 20 developers within 6 months, establish team processes, create documentation standards, manage multiple vendors, and ensure successful delivery of complex projects while taking on additional roles as Product Manager and Scrum Master since those positions were vacant.

**Action:**
- **Strategic Hiring:** I developed a comprehensive hiring process with technical assessments and cultural fit evaluations, working with multiple vendors to source quality developers
- **Process Establishment:** I created agile processes, code review standards, and documentation practices from day one
- **Distributed Team Management:** I established clear communication protocols and meeting schedules for the 70% India-based and 30% nearshore (Mexico, Costa Rica) team
- **Multi-Role Management:** I took on Product Manager and Scrum Master responsibilities, including Jira workflows, sprint planning, and backlog grooming
- **Vendor Coordination:** I managed relationships with multiple vendors providing developers while balancing internal stakeholder expectations
- **Performance Management:** I established clear performance criteria and had to make difficult decisions to let go 10 developers who didn't meet standards
- **Knowledge Sharing:** I implemented regular knowledge sharing sessions, pair programming, and mentoring programs

**Result:** **Successfully** built a team of 23 high-performing developers, delivered multiple projects on time, and created a scalable team management process. The team became known for its efficiency, quality of work, and strong documentation practices. I also established quarterly and yearly planning processes to manage management expectations effectively.

### Key Challenges Overcome:

1. Time Zone **Coordination**: Managing a distributed team with limited overlapping hours
2. **Vendor Management:** Balancing expectations **between** multiple vendors and internal stakeholders
3. **Performance Standards:** Maintaining high quality while scaling the team quickly
4. **Role Expansion:** Taking on additional responsibilities when key roles were vacant
5. **Team Building:** Creating a cohesive team culture across different locations and cultures

### Why This Was My Most Challenging Project:

- **Scale:** Building a team of 25+ people from scratch
- **Complexity:** Managing multiple technologies and project types simultaneously
- **Stakeholders:** Coordinating with vendors, management, and team members across different locations
- **Time Pressure:** Delivering results while building the team and processes
- **Multi-Role:** Taking on Product Manager and Scrum Master roles in addition to Engineering Manager responsibilities

### Lessons Learned:

1. **Process is Critical:** Having clear processes from the beginning prevents chaos and ensures consistency
2. **Communication is Key:** Regular, transparent communication is essential for distributed teams
3. **Quality Standards:** Maintaining high standards from the beginning is easier than trying to improve later
4. **Flexibility:** Being willing to take on additional roles when needed helps ensure project success
5. **Team Culture:** Building a positive team culture from the start creates long-term success

### How This Experience Prepares Me for Future Challenges:

This project taught me how to:
- Build and scale teams effectively
- Manage complex stakeholder relationships
- Create sustainable processes and documentation
- Handle multiple responsibilities simultaneously
- Make difficult decisions while maintaining team morale
- Work effectively in distributed environments

### Additional Challenging Project Example:

**Expedia Cloud Transition (2018-2023):** Leading the transition from Oracle Apps to modern microservices architecture while managing team dynamics and ensuring successful delivery despite initial resistance to new technologies. This required learning multiple new technologies quickly and managing a distributed team across different time zones.

This experience demonstrates my ability to handle complex, multi-faceted challenges while delivering results and building strong teams.
