"What is your greatest weakness?" is a tricky interview question, but it's also an opportunity to show self-awareness and growth potential. Here's how you can navigate it effectively:

<details>
<summary>Step 1: Choose the Right Weakness:</summary>
- Don't pick deal-breakers: Avoid mentioning weaknesses that directly contradict the job requirements or could raise red flags. For example, if the role requires strong public speaking, don't say you're shy.
- Focus on areas for improvement: Choose a genuine weakness you're actively working on, not something you've already mastered. This demonstrates self-awareness and a desire to learn.
- Keep it relevant: Ideally, select a weakness that can be mitigated or even turned into a strength under the right circumstances.
