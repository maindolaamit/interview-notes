## My Greatest Weakness: Impatience with Slow Learning Curves

**My greatest weakness is that I can sometimes be impatient when team members take longer to learn new technologies or adapt to changes, especially when I'm used to learning things quickly myself.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** At Expedia, when I transitioned from Oracle Apps to cloud engineering, I had to learn AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Java Spring Boot, and ReactJS simultaneously. I picked up these technologies relatively quickly and was able to deliver projects on time.

**Task:** However, I was working with teammates who were not as fast to learn these new technologies and were struggling to keep up with the project timeline, which was putting pressure on me to stretch and work extra hours.

**Action:** Initially, I found myself getting frustrated and working longer hours to compensate for the team's slower pace. This created stress and impacted my work-life balance. I realized I needed to change my approach.

**Result:** I learned to be more patient and supportive. I started creating detailed documentation, conducting knowledge sharing sessions, and implementing pair programming to help team members learn faster. I also learned to communicate better with management about realistic timelines and resource needs.

### How I'm Working to Improve:

1. **Documentation & Training:** I now create comprehensive documentation and training materials to help team members learn more effectively
2. **Mentoring Approach:** I've developed a more patient mentoring style, breaking down complex concepts into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Realistic Planning:** I now factor in learning curves when planning projects and communicate these needs to stakeholders
4. **Regular Check-ins:** I schedule regular one-on-ones to understand individual learning styles and provide personalized support

### Why This Weakness Can Be a Strength:

This weakness actually stems from my high standards and desire for excellence. By learning to be more patient and supportive, I've become a better leader who can help others grow and develop their skills, ultimately building stronger teams.

### Recent Example of Improvement:

At Nordstrom, when building my team from scratch, I implemented a structured onboarding process with clear learning paths, regular check-ins, and knowledge sharing sessions. This helped new team members ramp up more effectively while maintaining my high standards for quality and delivery.
