## Adapting to Major Career and Life Changes

**I'll share how I successfully adapted to multiple major changes throughout my career, including technology transitions, role changes, and life circumstances.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** In 2018, I was laid off from Expedia along with my entire team due to cost-cutting measures. This happened just 4 months after my family had moved to Seattle from India. I had to adapt to being unemployed, finding a new job in a different technology stack, and managing my family's transition back to India.

**Task:** I needed to quickly adapt to the new reality, find employment in Java and Cloud technologies (instead of my previous Oracle EBS expertise), and manage the emotional and practical challenges of this major life change.

**Action:**
- **Technology Transition:** I quickly pivoted from Oracle EBS to Java and Cloud technologies, updating my skills and resume
- **Interview Preparation:** I learned to handle leetcode-style interviews, which were new to me, through extensive practice
- **Network Leverage:** I reached out to my professional network and connections to explore opportunities
- **Family Management:** I maintained open communication with my family about the situation and managed their expectations
- **Skill Development:** I focused on learning new technologies and improving my interview skills
- **Persistence:** I maintained a positive attitude despite multiple interview rejections and continued to improve

**Result:** After several months of interviews and rejections, I successfully secured a position at Pepsico as an Associate Manager. This experience taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of continuous learning. I emerged stronger and more versatile in my technical skills.

### Key Adaptation Strategies I Used:

1. **Mindset Shift:** I embraced the change as an opportunity for growth rather than a setback
2. **Skill Pivoting:** I quickly identified transferable skills and learned new technologies
3. **Network Activation:** I leveraged my professional relationships to explore opportunities
4. **Continuous Learning:** I dedicated time to learning new skills and improving existing ones
5. **Emotional Resilience:** I maintained a positive attitude and focused on solutions

### Additional Adaptation Examples:

**Technology Transition at Expedia (2018):** When I transitioned from Oracle Apps to cloud engineering, I had to adapt to:
- New technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, ReactJS)
- Different team dynamics and communication styles
- Modern development practices and agile methodologies
- Distributed team management across time zones

**Role Evolution at Nordstrom (2025):** When I joined Nordstrom as a Manager, I had to adapt to:
- Building a team from scratch
- Managing multiple vendors and stakeholders
- Taking on Product Manager and Scrum Master roles
- Working with technologies I hadn't used extensively (Elastic Search, Kafka, Spark)

**Masters Program (2019-2021):** While working full-time, I adapted to:
- Balancing work and studies
- Learning new domains (Data Science, Machine Learning)
- Managing time effectively across multiple responsibilities
- Applying new knowledge to work projects

### How I Approach Change:

1. **Embrace the Opportunity:** I view change as a chance to learn and grow
2. **Assess the Situation:** I analyze what needs to change and what can be leveraged
3. **Create a Plan:** I develop a systematic approach to managing the transition
4. **Seek Support:** I reach out to mentors, colleagues, and my network for guidance
5. **Stay Flexible:** I remain open to adjusting my approach based on new information

### Why Adaptability is Crucial:

In today's fast-paced technology environment, adaptability is essential because:
- Technologies evolve rapidly

### Lessons Learned from Adapting to Change:

3. **Network is Valuable:** Strong professional relationships help during transitions
4. **Learning is Continuous:** Staying current with skills and knowledge is essential
5. **Resilience Matters:** The ability to bounce back from setbacks is crucial for success

### How This Experience Helps at Nordstrom:

My experience adapting to major changes demonstrates that I can:
- Handle uncertainty and ambiguity
- Learn new technologies and processes quickly
- Manage team transitions effectively
- Maintain performance during challenging times
- Lead others through change

### Personal Philosophy on Change:

I believe that change is an opportunity for growth and improvement. My approach is to:
