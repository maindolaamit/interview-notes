## A Time When I Failed: Poor Team Communication at Expedia

**I'll share a significant failure that taught me valuable lessons about team communication and management.**

### STAR Method Answer:

**Situation:** At Expedia in 2018, I was working as a Senior Software Engineer on a cloud engineering team. I was the only team member located in India while the rest of the team was in the US, creating time zone challenges and communication gaps.

**Task:** I was responsible for leading the transition from Oracle Apps to modern microservices architecture using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and ReactJS. The project had tight deadlines and high expectations from management.

**Action:** Initially, I tried to handle everything myself rather than effectively communicating the challenges to my US-based teammates. I worked long hours to compensate for the learning curve of other team members and didn't clearly communicate the workload distribution issues. I also didn't set proper expectations about the complexity of the transition.

**Result:** This led to severe work-life balance issues for me, stress within the team, and two team members eventually confronting me about the workload and expressing shame that they couldn't help me effectively. The project was delivered, but at a significant personal and team cost.

### What I Learned:

1. **Importance of Clear Communication:** I learned that honest, transparent communication about challenges and workload is crucial for team success
2. **Setting Realistic Expectations:** I should have communicated the complexity of the transition to management and set more realistic timelines
3. **Distributed Team Management:** I learned the importance of establishing clear communication protocols for distributed teams
4. **Asking for Help:** I realized that trying to do everything myself was counterproductive and that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness

### How I Applied These Lessons:

**At Nordstrom:** When building my team from scratch, I implemented:
- Clear communication protocols for distributed teams
- Regular one-on-ones and team meetings
- Transparent workload distribution and capacity planning
- Open discussions about challenges and roadblocks
- Structured onboarding and knowledge sharing processes

### The Positive Outcome:

The confrontation with my teammates at Expedia actually led to a breakthrough. We had an honest conversation about our challenges, and I was able to share my concerns openly. This led to better collaboration, more realistic project planning, and improved team dynamics. It taught me that vulnerability and honest communication can strengthen relationships and lead to better outcomes.

### Why This Failure Made Me Better:

This experience made me a more empathetic leader who understands the importance of clear communication, realistic expectations, and supporting team members through challenging transitions. It's a failure I'm grateful for because it fundamentally changed how I approach team management and communication.
