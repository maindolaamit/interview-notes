TDD is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. The process follows three simple steps:

1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass (Green)
3. Refactor the code while keeping tests green (Refactor)

## Examples Overview

We'll explore TDD through 5 progressively complex examples:

1. [String Calculator](./string-calculator)
2. [Password Validator](./password-validator)
3. [Bank Account Operations](./bank-account)
4. [Shopping Cart](./shopping-cart)
5. [Order Processing System](./order-processing)

Each example demonstrates TDD principles while increasing in complexity.

- Order Processing](./order-processing.mdx)
