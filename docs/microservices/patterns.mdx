## Service Discovery?


## Observability patterns
Understanding and diagnosing problem in a microservice architecture is much more complicated.
A request can bound around multiple services before a response is finally returns to a client.
In addition, there will not be a single log file to check but multiple files.
Similarly, problem with latency are more difficult to diagnose due to multiple service calls.

You can use the following pattern to design observable services:
- `Health Check API` : Expose an endpoint that returns the health of the service
- `Log aggregation`: Log service activity and write logs into a centralized logging
server, which provides searching and alerting.
- `Distributed tracing`: Assign each external request a unique ID and trace requests
as they flow between services.
- `Exception tracking` : Report exceptions to an exception tracking service, which
deduplicates exceptions, alerts developers, and tracks the resolution of each
exception.
- `Application metrics` : Maintain metrics, such as counters and gauges, and expose
them to a metrics server.
- `Audit logging` :Log user actions

## Security Patterns
In a microservice architecture, users are typically authenticated by the API gateway.
It must then pass information about the user, such as identity and roles, to the services it invokes.
A common solution is to apply the Access token pattern.
The API gateway passes an access token, such as JWT (JSON Web Token), to the services,
which can validate the token and collect information about the user.

:::tip
The goal of continuous delivery/deployment (and, more generally, DevOps) is to rapidly yet reliably deliver software.
Four useful metrics for assessing software development are as follows:
  - `Deployment frequency`: How often software is deployed into production
  - `Lead time`: Time from a developer checking in a change to that change being deployed
  - `Meantime to recover`: Time to recover from a production problem
  - `Change failure rate`: Percentage of changes that result in a production problem
