When deploying a **microservices architecture** on AWS,
you will use a combination of services to handle different aspects of the system,
such as compute, networking, storage, monitoring, and communication.

Below is a categorized list of AWS services commonly used for deploying microservices:

---

### **1. Compute Services**
These services provide the infrastructure to run your microservices.

- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**:
    - A fully managed container orchestration service for deploying containerized applications.
    - Works well with AWS-native integrations.

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**:
    - A managed Kubernetes service for running Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
    - Ideal for teams already familiar with Kubernetes.

- **AWS Fargate**:
    - A serverless compute engine for containers that works with ECS and EKS.
    - Eliminates the need to manage servers or clusters.

- **AWS Lambda**:
    - A serverless compute service for running microservices without provisioning infrastructure.
    - Suitable for event-driven architectures or lightweight services.

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:
    - Virtual machines for hosting microservices when more control over the infrastructure is needed.

---

### **2. Networking and Communication**
These services enable secure and efficient communication between microservices.

- **Amazon API Gateway**:
    - Acts as a front door for your microservices, handling request routing, authentication, and throttling.
    - Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs.

- **AWS App Mesh**:
    - A service mesh that provides observability and controls communication between microservices.
    - Useful for managing service-to-service communication in distributed systems.

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (e.g., ECS tasks or EC2 instances).
    - Includes Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and Network Load Balancer (NLB) for TCP/UDP traffic.

- **Route 53**:
    - A scalable domain name system (DNS) web service for routing traffic to microservices.
    - Supports domain registration, DNS routing, and health checks.

---

### **3. Storage and Databases**
These services store data used by your microservices.

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
    - Managed relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Aurora.
    - Each microservice can have its own database instance to ensure isolation.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**:
    - A fully managed NoSQL database for high-performance, low-latency data storage.
    - Ideal for event-driven architectures or when scalability is critical.

- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
    - Object storage service for storing static assets like files, logs, or backups.

- **Amazon ElastiCache**:
    - In-memory caching service using Redis or Memcached to improve performance by reducing database load.

---

### **4. Messaging and Event Streaming**
These services enable asynchronous communication between microservices.

- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**:
    - A message queue service that decouples services by enabling asynchronous communication.

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**:
    - A pub/sub messaging service that allows one-to-many communication between services.

- **Amazon EventBridge**:
    - An event bus that enables event-driven architectures by routing events between AWS services and custom applications.

- **Amazon Kinesis**:
    - A real-time data streaming service for processing large volumes of data in motion.

---

### **5. Monitoring and Observability**
These services help monitor the health and performance of your microservices.

- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
    - Monitors logs, metrics, and events from your microservices.

- **AWS X-Ray**:
    - Provides distributed tracing to analyze requests as they flow through your microservices.

- **AWS CloudTrail**:
    - Tracks API activity across AWS services for auditing purposes.

---

### **6. Security**
These services ensure secure access and data protection in your architecture.

- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
    - Manages access control to AWS resources at a granular level.

- **AWS Secrets Manager**:
    - Securely stores sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.

- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**:
    - Protects your APIs from common web exploits like SQL injection or DDoS attacks.

---

### **7. CI/CD and Deployment**
These services automate the deployment process for your microservices.

- **AWS CodePipeline**:
    - Automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your application lifecycle.

- **AWS CodeBuild**:
    - Builds source code into deployable artifacts.

- **AWS CodeDeploy**:
    - Automates deployments to ECS, Lambda, or EC2 instances.

- **AWS CodeCommit**:
    - A version control system similar to GitHub but hosted on AWS.

---

### Example Architecture
A typical AWS-based microservice architecture might include:

1. Compute: Use Amazon ECS with Fargate to run containerized microservices.
2. Networking: Use API Gateway as an entry point with App Mesh managing inter-service communication.
3. Storage: Use DynamoDB for NoSQL storage and RDS for relational databases.
4. Messaging: Use SQS for asynchronous communication between services.
5. Monitoring: Use CloudWatch for logging and X-Ray for tracing requests across services.
6. Security: Use IAM roles and Secrets Manager to secure access to resources.
