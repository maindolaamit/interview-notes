The popular 3 layered architecture organizes the application’s classes into the following tiers or layers:
- Presentation layer—Contains code that implements the user interface or external APIs
- Business logic layer—Contains the business logic
- Persistence layer—Implements the logic of interacting with the database

Even though it is a great example of architecture style but has some significant drawbacks:
- Single presentation layer: It doesn’t represent the fact that an application is likely
to be invoked by more than just a single system.
- Single persistence layer:It doesn’t represent the fact that an application is likely
to interact with more than just a single database.
- Defines the business logic layer as depending on the persistence layer—In theory, this
dependency prevents you from testing the business logic without the database.


A domain model is created using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. The domain model is a representation of the domain concepts and the relationships between them. It is a collection of classes that represent the domain concepts and the relationships between them.
 The domain model is used to implement the business logic of the application.
