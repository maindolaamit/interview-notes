### What are Micro-Services?
Microservices are an architectural style for building applications as a collection of small, independent services.
Each service focuses on a single business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
This approach contrasts with the traditional monolithic architecture, where a single large application encompasses all functionalities.

Here are some key characteristics of microservices:
- Independent deployment: Each microservice can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. This allows for faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
- Loose coupling: Services are loosely coupled, meaning they have minimal dependencies on each other. This improves fault tolerance and makes it easier to evolve individual services without affecting others.
- Technology agnostic: Services can be implemented using different programming languages and technologies, promoting flexibility and leveraging the strengths of specific tools for each task.
- Focus on business capabilities: Each service aligns with a specific business capability, making the application easier to understand and manage.
- Highly maintainable and testable
- Owned by a small team

:::note
Microservices are often associated with the DevOps and Agile methodologies, as they promote rapid development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

### Why Micro-Services?
- **Scalability**: Micro-Services can be scaled independently
- **Technology Heterogeneity**: Micro-Services allows you to use different technologies
- **Resilience**: Micro-Services are isolated from each other, so a failure in one service doesn't affect the other
- **Ease of Deployment**: Micro-Services can be deployed independently
- **Organizational Alignment**: Micro-Services can be developed by small teams
- **Composability**: Micro-Services can be composed to create new services
- **Optimizing for Replaceability**: Micro-Services can be replaced easily

### What are the challenges of Micro-Services?
- **Distributed Systems**: Micro-Services are distributed systems, so you need to deal with all the issues of distributed systems
- **Data Management**: Micro-Services have their own databases, so you need to deal with data consistency
- **Network Latency**: Micro-Services communicate over the network, so you need to deal with network latency
- **Security**: Micro-Services need to be secured
- **Monitoring**: Micro-Services need to be monitored
- **Testing**: Micro-Services need to be tested
- **Deployment**: Micro-Services need to be deployed
- **DevOps**: Micro-Services need DevOps
- **Organizational Complexity**: Micro-Services need to be managed

### What are the best practices for Micro-Services?
- **Design for failure**: Micro-Services should be designed for failure
- **Decentralize all the things**: Micro-Services should be decentralized
- **Automate everything**: Micro-Services should be automated
- **Monitor everything**: Micro-Services should be monitored
- **Secure everything**: Micro-Services should be secured
- **Test everything**: Micro-Services should be tested
- **Deploy everything**: Micro-Services should be deployed
- **Manage everything**: Micro-Services should be managed
