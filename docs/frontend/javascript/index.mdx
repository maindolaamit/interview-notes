## JavaScript Interview Questions

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

### What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
`null` is an assigned value. It means nothing. `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

### What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
`==` checks for equality only after doing necessary type conversions. `===` checks for equality without doing any type conversion.

### What is the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`?

- `var` is function-scoped when declared inside a function.
- `let` is block-scoped.
- `const` is a constant value and cannot be reassigned.

### What is the difference between `function` and `arrow function`?
Arrow functions are always anonymous. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Arrow functions do not have arguments.

### What is the difference between `find` and `filter`?
`find` returns the first match. `filter` returns all matches.

### What is the difference between `slice` and `splice`?
`slice` does not modify the original array. `splice` modifies the original array.
